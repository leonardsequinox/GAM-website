              <h4><a href="">Audit</a></h4>
              <p>In accordance with the Companies Act, 2017, a company registered under this Act is required to file with
                the Registrar of Companies an annual return that includes, inter alia, its audited financial statements.
                Apart from being a statutory requirement, an independent audit is the foundation for decision-making by
                most stakeholders. For instance, an independent audit provides assurance to the shareholders that those
                they have charged with the governance of the company are doing so diligently and applying the resources
                entrusted to them in an effective and efficient manner. The principal goal of our firm is to provide this
                assurance. Our audit services are underpinned by a commitment to provide a constructive and challenging
                audit.</p>
